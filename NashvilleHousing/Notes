There are total of 5w+ rows in the NashvilleHousing dataset.
I encountered many problems when importing the data because of the data format.
If there are many warnings when dealing with a certain column, the fastest way I think is to import as 'txt' format and then deal with the format in the SQL.

So in this project, I first standardized the data format. Mainly used CONVERT() function.

Then populated PropertyAddress data. I found that there are some rules between ParcelID and PropertyAddress.
So I used JOIN() function to update this column information.

Next I broke out Address into Individual Columns. These address data includes street, city, and state information in one column. 
So I broke them into 3 individual columns, which would be convenient for future analysis.
Mainly used SUBSTRING(), LOCATE(), SUBSTRING_INDEX() function.

In the SoldAsVaccant column, I found that there were 'Y','N','Yes','No'. I hope they can be consistent.
Mainly used CASE WHEN function.

Looking through the data, some rows were probably duplicates.
I used ROW_NUMBER() and PARTITION BY() to find the duplicates, used CTE to store the temp data.
But MySQL can't delete data directly through CTE. So I used JOIN() function to delete duplicates.

Lastly deleted some unused columns.
Noted MySQL can't drop multiple columns at one time, must drop one by one.
